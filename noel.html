			This is the <a href="images/noelpic.jpg"target="_blank"> Humanities</a> portion of my Coding the Past project. 
			In Humanities, we were assigned to create a layered portrait of our interviewee. 
			This was followed by a reflection of that same portrait.
			In my refelection, I explain style attributes of the image. 
			Afterward, we chose a main idea from our interview and crafted an essay about it.
			The person I chose to interview was my father.
			My reason for choosing him is due to the fact that he has a very interesting story to tell.
			During this project, I grew closer to my father and discovered things I never would've known.

			This is the <a href="images/noelpic.jpg"target="_blank"> Humanities</a> portion of my Timely Solution project.
			In Humanities, we were assigned to create two art pieces based off of precreated poems.
			The first art piece was based off of the Industrial Revolution. Following our World History content. 
			My first poem was about child labor during the Industrial revolution. 
			I crafted my collage out of canvas, paint, and eyes cut out of magazine papers. 
			My second poem was about social media and race. 
			I crafted this collage out of paint and canvas. 
			Reasons for my design choices can be found in the links and/or descriptions below.
