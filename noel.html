			This is the <a href="https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/MTA1MDEyNTgyMzBa"target="_blank"> Humanities</a> portion of my project. 
			In Humanities, we were assigned to create a layered portrait of our interviewee. 
			This was followed by a reflection of that same portrait.
			In my refelection, I explain style attributes of the image. 
			Afterward, we chose a main idea from our interview and crafted an essay about it.
			The person I chose to interview was my father.
			My reason for choosing him is due to the fact that he has a very interesting story to tell.
			During this project, I grew closer to my father and discovered things I never would've known.
